-Reply with "+accept [name of gift-card]" to claim your gift-card from [egifter.com](https://www.egifter.com/giftcards) 
Simply go to their website and pick what company you would like your gift card from. Example, if you were to choose Amazon as your card that
you would like for your gift then the accept command would look like this "%s Amazon " 
Once you send the accept command it can take a few minutes to get your card sent to your reddit inbox. If it does not come within
an hour then contact /u/bigdred777 or /u/TheLobstrosity so that we can make sure you get your card.
-If you would like to pass the gift to another random person, reply with "+pass random".  
-If you would like to pass to another Redditor, then reply with "+pass [name of redditor] " to pass it to a specific redditor. Redditor must be in giveaway to win. 
-You have 72 hours (3 days) to reply to this message. If you have not replied by then, a new winner will be picked.
*To re-enter the giveaway you will need to post a new link thread with a picture of something you bought with your gift card, 
also write down on a piece of paper your reddit username and include that in the picture. Then simply comment in your thread and
include the "+enter again" command. A admin will then manually verify your picture and then will add you back into the giveaway.
You will receive conformation of your re-entry.
